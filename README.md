### What I learned

This project was by far the most difficult frontend mentor project I've ever undertaken. Though challenging, it was quite a fun and valuable learning experience for me.

I wanted to make use of and try ViteJS to initialize this project with React and style the components with styled components for quicker development and easier maintainability. It also has the potential to be a minor component for a larger, fullstack version of this project.

#### Initializing with ViteJS was easy:

```git
 npm create vite@latest
```

to start the process and choosing React as the template for the project. For now I opted for Vanilla Javascript instead of Typescript but in future project I will begin integrating Typescript to get more practice with it.

#### Using Styled Components:

```js

```
